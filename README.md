### Introduction <br>
Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, is facing a major food insecurity crisis,  with around 33% of its population approximately 8.8 million people affected. This issue is especially severe in the southern regions, where over 1.6 million people experience extreme levels of food insecurity, leading to widespread malnutrition, particularly among children. The crisis is driven by various factors, including dependence on agriculture, which supports 70-80% of the population, and vulnerability to climate change impacts like droughts and irregular rainfall. These challenges threaten both the economic stability and long-term development of the country, making Madagascar a key focus for addressing food insecurity and finding sustainable solutions.<br>
### Aim
The aim of this project is to identify the main factors that affect food security in Madagascar. By using predicted population growth, the project aims to determine the needed crop yield in the future such that Madagascar will be able to prepare better for the future and be able to improve food security.

### Problem Statement
How might we utilize our model to accurately predict crop yield such that we can better prepare for food insecurity?
